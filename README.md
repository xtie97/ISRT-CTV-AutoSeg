# Multi-Modality Artificial Intelligence for Involved-Site Radiation Therapy: Clinical Target Volume Delineation in High-Risk Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma

## Overview

This repository provides a deep learning framework for **automatic CTV delineation in ISRT**, with a focus on
oncologic imaging workflows in radiation therapy. The project aims to reduce contouring variability,
improve efficiency, and support clinically meaningful target definition.

The pipeline is designed to work with **longitudinal imaging data** (e.g., baseline and interim PET/CT or MRI)
and is motivated by real-world clinical scenarios in radiation oncology.
